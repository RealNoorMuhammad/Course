        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the $COURSE Academy, the most prestigious (and totally
          unofficial) University of Meme Studies. By using our platform, you
          agree that we may roast your data, but don’t worry – we don’t sell it
          to fake “gurus.” We’re here for the memes, not scams.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          - Your memes, usernames, and wallet address (for SOL rewards).  
          - Any cringe “get rich quick” content you upload for roasting.  
          - No boring legal stuff. Just what’s needed to make memes fun.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          - To showcase memes on the leaderboard.  
          - To give “Professor” ranks to top roasters.  
          - To laugh at scammers and their fake courses.  
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t share your data with gurus, clowns, or “7-figure dropshippers.”  
          But we might display your memes publicly – because that’s the point.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We secure your memes in the blockchain halls of $COURSE Academy.  
          Basically, they’re safer than the “financial freedom” courses you see online.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>
          If you have questions about this totally legit Privacy Policy,  
          send us a meme instead of an email. Memes > Legal jargon.
